      body: |
        balenaOS devices drop privileges after starting OpenVPN so the SIGUSR1
         is unable to recreate the socket.

        Instead, have the server push the ping-exit directive as per the
        OpenVPN docs. This way balenaOS will stop and restart the service.

    - subject: Stop automatic int parsing of openvpn events to avoid false positives
      hash: 4c3a358d48271746b395446ba71977f320bfa973
      body: |
        This avoids the case where a uuid could be a valid int and be parsed as
        a false positive and cause issues. It also avoids the overhead of
        parsing ints when their parsed form may never be needed.

      body: |
        This avoids situations where due to client disconnection delays we end
        up with clients being disconnected at a slower cadence than expected
        and meaning that there may still be significant numbers connected at
        the point the SIGTERM timeout is reached

      hash: e32082bc6e52fd57b9bd15402e1a8b29246b9847
      body: |
        This solves an issue that could happen where the device reconnects in
        rapid succession and connects to another VPN container and then back to
        the current one without yet having been recognized as disconnected from
        the current VPN container and as such we would not send a connect event
        for the reconnection. This would result in the device appearing to be
        offline for the API (because it disconnected from the other instance)
        whilst actually still being connected, just to this instance

      body: |
        Using an auth-user-pass-verify script it is executed synchronously and
        will block all VPN traffic for the duration which is far from ideal
        when there are many clients authenticating concurrently and it also
        needs to authenticate against the remote api server so switching to a
        plugin that allows async authorization should provide large benefits

      hash: 5756684de3befaaa2514d44d7e1dbcb22d522a02
      body: |
        The code in the captureException() method 'try's
        to get an ID. If it fails, it 'finally' registers
        the exception passed to it. Unfortunately, because
        it doesn't 'catch', if the 'try' fails, then the
        error from it bubbles up and the code calling
        'captureException' does not finalise. This is
        most prevalent should the API not currently be
        running, as it won't register and the timed retry
        to register will never get called.

        This will also fix other calls made with it.

                Debian Buster now uses Avahi 0.7 instead of
                0.6.32. This means that there is now a stricter
                policy defining MDNS domains. This commit allows
                us to use multipart subdomains.

        Add an additional check to the actions allowed when tunnelling
        ports through the connect-proxy. This means that if the key used
        is sufficiently privileged then any port can be tunnelled to a
        device.

        * Handle client authentication via management events.

        * Generate custom, more fine grained, logs; openvpn log verbosity can be
          toggled with SIGUSR2.
        * Use `child_process.spawn` in place of `forever.Monitor` meaning a
        process
          exit will cause the worker process it be restarted meaning the restart will
          pass through the initialisation flow again.
        * Gather client events and publish for Prometheus (session bitrate +
        length,
          total bytes rx/tx, online clients, total clients, auth failures).
