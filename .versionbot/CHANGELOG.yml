      hash: 903950b69a89b02fe1dc3320993a6ad1c9604c4a
      body: |
        This will make it more likely for reports to be batched and increase
        the batch size, reducing the number of requests necessary without
        adding a significant delay for reporting, this will also help throttle
        in the case of report failures

        important to the api then comparing just that allows us to simplify the
        code and ensure we only update when truly necessary

                        This allows consumers like pinejs-client-supertest
                        to have all the methods returning different Promise
                        types based solely on the implementation of the
                        request() method.

      hash: 5756684de3befaaa2514d44d7e1dbcb22d522a02
      body: |
        The code in the captureException() method 'try's
        to get an ID. If it fails, it 'finally' registers
        the exception passed to it. Unfortunately, because
        it doesn't 'catch', if the 'try' fails, then the
        error from it bubbles up and the code calling
        'captureException' does not finalise. This is
        most prevalent should the API not currently be
        running, as it won't register and the timed retry
        to register will never get called.

        This will also fix other calls made with it.

                Debian Buster now uses Avahi 0.7 instead of

                policy defining MDNS domains. This commit allows
                us to use multipart subdomains.

      body: |
        Add an additional check to the actions allowed when tunnelling
        ports through the connect-proxy. This means that if the key used
        is sufficiently privileged then any port can be tunnelled to a
        device.

        * Handle client authentication via management events.

        * Generate custom, more fine grained, logs; openvpn log verbosity can be
          toggled with SIGUSR2.
        * Use `child_process.spawn` in place of `forever.Monitor` meaning a process
          exit will cause the worker process it be restarted meaning the restart will
          pass through the initialisation flow again.
        * Gather client events and publish for Prometheus (session bitrate + length,
          total bytes rx/tx, online clients, total clients, auth failures).
